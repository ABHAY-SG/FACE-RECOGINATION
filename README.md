# Face Recognition Attendance System

A Python-based attendance system that uses **face recognition** to automatically mark attendance, record entry time, and save details into an Excel sheet. The system also provides **voice feedback** when a personâ€™s attendance is marked.

## Features
- Detects and recognizes faces in real-time using a webcam.
- Stores known faces from a demo_photos folder (`demo_photos/`).
- Marks attendance with **Name, Date, Time, and Status** (On Time / Late).
- Prevents duplicate entries for the same day.
- Saves attendance records into `attendance.xlsx` (new sheet created daily).
- Voice announcement using **pyttsx3**.
- Shows total number of people present on the live video feed.
